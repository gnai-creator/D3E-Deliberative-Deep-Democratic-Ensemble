# D3E: Deliberative Deep Democratic Ensemble

A neural architecture for model-level consensus inspired by deliberative democratic systems. Each model acts as an autonomous entity with a defined institutional role: jurors, lawyer, judge, and supreme judge. Together, they simulate a courtroom-like process to iteratively refine and validate predictions.

## ðŸ§  Core Idea

Traditional ensemble methods aggregate predictions statically. D3E, in contrast, uses a **hierarchical and deliberative approach**:

1. **Jurors** independently vote on a sample.
2. **Lawyer (SimuV4)** synthesizes these votes into a higher-level representation.
3. **Judge (SimuV5)** interprets this representation and outputs a refined decision.
4. **Supreme Judge** evaluates the confidence and decides to accept or request a new deliberation round.

## ðŸ¤– Scaling to Multiple Robots

Each robot runs a local instance of the entire D3E stack. Coordination between robots is optional and occurs only at the Supreme level if needed.

### Local Roles per Robot:
| Role          | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Jurors        | Local classifiers                         |
| Lawyer        | Aggregates local juror decisions          |
| Judge         | Makes informed decisions from aggregation |
| Supreme Judge | Validates confidence and consensus        |

### Federation (optional):
Robots can send their local consensus decisions to a central coordination node for arbitration or global consensus tracking.

## ðŸ”Œ Input / Output Specification

### Input:
- Tensor of shape `(1, 30, 30, 1, C)` where `C` = channels (4 for jurors, 40 for judge)

### Output:
```json
{
  "decision": [[...]],
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "consensus": true,
  "task_id": "abc123"
}
```
